python  is a general purpose high level programming  language .
father of python is GUIDO VAN ROSSAM ==>1989 AT NETHERLAND NATIONAL INSITITUTE
1991  OFFICIAL DOB OF FEB 20 1991

FIRST Language for easy learning 
--------------------------
programs can be written easily with less code
jshell 2017 sept 21  system.out.println for printing hello world. single line
c,java ===> are Statically typed language
python ===> Dynamically typed language
--------------------------
PYTHON ===>BBC channel (1969 to 1974)
monty python's flying circus
Hadoop ===>yellow cap elephant

python is embedded with 
1)Functional programming from C lang
2)OOP's concept from C++
3)Scripting language features from PERL AND SHELL script
4)Modular programming features from Modula-3

syntax from C and ABC Language

where we can use python?
 1. We can develop desktop applications(eg: calculator)
 2. Web applications(Django as web application framework  used in python)
 3. Database applications
 4. For Networking application
 5. For gaming
 6. Data Analysis with python
 7. Machine Learning
 8. AI
 9. for IoT applications
 10.for mobile application(but not sure)
 
 
 which companies use Python?
 --------------------
 Google
 Youtube
 Dropbox
 NASA
 NSE

Features of python:
-------------------
1. Simple and Easy to learn *
2. Free ware and open source(source code can be seen)
   (-keywords in java 53
     keywords in Python 30
   jython is customized from python for java programs with python)
3. High level programming language
4. Python is also paltform independent(write once and Run anywhere(WORA))*
5. Portability *
6. Dynamically typed programs ****
7. Both procedure oriented and  object oriented ****
8. Interpreted programming language
9. Extensible(we can use java,c programs,
               we can improve performance of application,
			   performance of pyhton programs can be improved by some other programming functionality
			   non python code can made used by extensible feature) ******
10.Embedded	(we use python programs in any other programming languages also)******
11.Extensive library(i.e we can import libraries)*************


Limitations of python
---------------------
1.performance(as it is interpreted{can see only 1 line} language)  it is not upto the mark
2.Mobile applications
